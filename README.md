### **Python-Tkinter Math Flash Cards Legacy Release**

This release contains some of the old code that I used to get to where the project is today! These are very much early experimental builds, with many bugs, and anti-user friendly practices

### **V0.1.0**

Very very early code, and some of the first python code I ever wrote, this doesn't even use tkinter, so technically the title is lying, however this code is used in all the future builds, however in future builds (mainly v0,2.3) this code was tweaked

### **V0.2.0**

Again very bare bones, however now actually using tkinter! this is the same code as the one used in V0.1.0 but implemented with tkinter, many graphical bugs, and arguably worse off the the V0.1.0 build, but this is my first attempt with tkinter
